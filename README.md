## Python Homework - Py Me Up, Charlie  

### This project consists of two Python challenges that have real-world situations: PyBank and PyPoll.   

#### Before beginning, a repository, named "python-challenge",  had to be created and cloned to my local computer. Within the repository, two main directories were created (PyBank and PyPoll), each containing folders: Resource and analysis. The Resource folder had to have a csv file that is paticular to the assignment. The analysis folder will hold the final .txt file with the results. Lastly, the final product of my endeavour was having a main.py file which contained the solved Python script.

### Scenario: create a Python script that analyzes financial records of a company. I must use the dataset [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv)


* #### Tasks:
   * ##### Import, open csv file
   * ##### Calculate total number of months included in dataset
   * ##### The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
   * ##### Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
   * ##### The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
   * ##### The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

## *PyPoll*

### Scenario: create a Python script that helps a small, rural town modernize its voting process. I must use the dataset [election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv)


* #### Tasks:
   * ##### Import, open csv file
   * ##### The total number of votes cast 
   * ##### A complete list of candidates who received votes
   * ##### The percentage of votes each candidate won
   * ##### The total number of votes each candidate won
   * ##### The winner of the election based on popular vote.
